FastLibrary
===========
A simple, minimal Android util framework library
------------------------------------------------
From the [Devil's Dictionary of Programming](http://programmingisterrible.com/post/65781074112/devils-dictionary-of-programming):
-   simple — It solves my use case.
-   minimal — You’re going to have to write more code than I did to make it useful.
-   util — A collection of wrappers around the standard library, battle worn, and copy-pasted from last weeks project into next weeks.
-   framework — A product with the business logic removed, but all of the assumptions left in.

Realistically, this library might not be of much use to you.
Feel free to look at the implementation, read the documentation to see what each part does, and take what you want.
